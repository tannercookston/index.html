<p>
Hello, I am a freshman at Mississippi State University. I am majoring in Business Information Systems or BIS for short. 
I am from Fort Mill, South Carolina which is about 45 minutes north of Columbia. My hobbies include anything in the outdoors, programming and learning 
how computers work. I have always had a passion for messing with computers and finding out how they work. I am very interested in Web Development and I am excited to learn.
